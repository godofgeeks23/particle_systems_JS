# particle_systems_JS

My JavaScript Particle system, which I created using JavaScript Canvas, from scratch. Pure Vanilla JavaScript used.

This can be used for many purposes - as a backgound for WebPages, in interactive WebPages, for graphic designing, visual Physics, or just for Fun in Coding and brushing up your JavaScript Skills. 
This is Creative Coding - the possibilities are endless!
